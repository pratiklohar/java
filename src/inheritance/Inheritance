Inheritance
-----------

- In Java, Inheritance means creating new classes based on existing ones.
- A class that inherits from another class can reuse the methods and fields of that class.
- In addition, you can add new fields and methods to your current class as well.
- A class can inherit the other class using "extends" keyword.
- "extends" keywords indicates current class is derived from an existing class.
- A class can extend only 1 class.


Use:
- Code Reusability.

GoodToKnow:
- Method Overriding is achievable only through Inheritance.
- Java Inheritance Types:
    1.Single
    2.Multilevel
    3.Hierarchical
- Java does not support multiple inheritances with classes.
- We can achieve multiple inheritance only through Interfaces.
- If you don't want other classes to inherit from a class, use the final keyword:

                              |
