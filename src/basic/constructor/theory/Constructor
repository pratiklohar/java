- A basic.constructor is a special method that is used to initialize objects.
- The basic.constructor is called when an object of a class is created.
- It is called basic.constructor because it constructs the values at the time of object creation.
- It is not necessary to write a basic.constructor for a class because java compiler creates a default basic.constructor(i.e nor-arg basic.constructor) if your class doesn't have any.
- Every time an object is created using the new() keyword, at least one basic.constructor is called.


How Java Constructors are Different From Java Methods?

- Constructors must have the same name as the class within which it is defined it is not necessary for the method in Java.
- Constructors do not return any type while method(s) have the return type or void if does not return any value.
- Constructors are called only once at the time of Object creation while method(s) can be called any number of times.
- A Java basic.constructor cannot be abstract, static, final, and synchronized.
- We can use access modifiers while declaring a basic.constructor. It controls the object creation. In other words, we can have private, protected, public or default basic.constructor in Java.



Types of Constructors
- Default Constructor AKA No-Arg Constructor (Constructor with no arguments)
- Parameterised Constructor (Constructor with arguments)

Default Constructor
- A basic.constructor is called default basic.constructor when it doesn't have any parameter.
- Default basic.constructor is used to provide the default values to the object like 0, null, etc., depending on the type.
- If there is no basic.constructor in a class, compiler automatically creates a default basic.constructor.

Parameterised Constructor
- A basic.constructor is called a parameterized basic.constructor when it has specific number of parameters.
- The parameterized basic.constructor is used to provide different values to distinct objects. However, you can provide the same values also.



Constructor Overloading

- Constructor is just like a method but without return type.
- It can also be overloaded like Java methods.
- Constructor basic.overloading in Java is a technique of having more than one basic.constructor with different parameter lists.
- They are arranged in a way that each basic.constructor performs a different task.
- They are differentiated by the compiler by the number of parameters in the list and their types.
