Method Overriding
-----------------

- Overriding occurs when a subclass provides the implementation of method already written in superclass.
- The method in the subclass must have the same signature as in the superclass.
- There must be an IS-A relationship (basic.inheritance).
- AKA runtime time polymorphism, late binding.

Use
---
- Method overriding is used to provide the specific implementation of a method which is already provided by its superclass.

GoodToKnow
----------
- If we donâ€™t want a method to be overridden, we declare it as final.
- Static methods can not be overridden.
- Private methods can not be overridden.
- Method Overriding is achievable only through Inheritance.
