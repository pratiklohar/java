/**
 * <h1>Methode Overriding</h1>
 * <p>Overriding occurs when a subclass provides the implementation of method already written in superclass.
 * <p>The method in the subclass must have the same signature as in the superclass.
 * <p>There must be an IS-A relationship (inheritance or interface).
 * <p>Method Overriding is achievable only through Inheritance or Interface.
 * <p>If we donâ€™t want a method to be overridden, we declare it as final.
 * <p>Static methods can not be overridden.
 * <p>Private methods can not be overridden.
 * <p>Also known as runtime time polymorphism, late binding.
