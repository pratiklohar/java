static keyword
--------------
- variables, methods, blocks, nested classes can be declared as static.
- Static variables and methods are allocated memory space only once during the execution of the program.
- This memory space is shared by all objects of the class, which makes static members useful for maintaining global state or shared functionality.
- Static members and methods can be access using class name, without the need to create an instance of the class.


Static Variable
---------------
- Static variables are associated with the class, not with an object of class. This means that changes to a static fields are reflected in all instances of that class.
- We can define static variables at the class level only. if we define static variable inside any function compiler will throw an error.


Static Method
-------------
- Static methods cannot access non-static members of a class, as they are not associated with any particular instance of the class.
- Static methods can be overloaded, However they cannot be overridden, as they are associated with the class rather than with a particular instance of the class.


Static Block
------------
- Static block and static variables are executed in the order they are present in a program.


Static Classes
--------------
- We cannot declare a top-level class as a static modifier but can declare nested classes as static.
