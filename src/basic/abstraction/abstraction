 Abstraction
 -----------

- Abstraction in Java is the process of hiding the implementation details and only showing the essential functionality to the user.
- Abstraction in java is achieved using abstract classes and abstract basic.interfaces.
- We can achieve 100% basic.abstraction using basic.interfaces.


Abstract class
--------------

- An abstract class must be declared with "abstract" keyword.
- An abstract class can have abstract methods and non-abstract/concrete methods.
- An abstract class can extend another class and implement interface.
- If a class contains at least one abstract method then class must be declared as abstract.
- Abstract class canâ€™t be instantiated.i.e. We cannot create an object of the abstract class but abstract class object can take the reference of its child class and call its methods or fields.


Abstract Methods
----------------

- Abstract method must be declared with "abstract" keyword.
- Abstract methods are declared, they do not have body. Thus, a subclass must override all abstract methods of superclass and provide methode implementation.
- Any concrete class that extends an abstract class must override its all abstract methods else the concrete class has to be declared as abstract as well.

GoodToKnow:
- An abstract keyword/modifier is applicable for classes and methods in Java not for variables.
